# Matrix-factorization-for-Recommender-System

This repository focuses on some classic methods in matrix factorization for recommender system.


We implemented basic matrix factorization and also added item biase & user biase to the method to improve it. These methods are also applicable for knowledge base completion which is another project I have been working on.

The optimization method using in this project is Stochastic Gradient Decent, but we also improved it a little for different usage in different background.

The test dataset in our model is [Movielens 100k](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). You can download the dataset from their website.
